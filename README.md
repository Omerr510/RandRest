This is a guide about how to get the JSON file of your restaurants from Cibus

Step A :
  1. Log in to the Cibus website
  2. Go to the inspect section on your browser (F12)
  3. Click on the Network tab
  4. If the Network tab is empty, refresh the page (F5).
  5. In the Network tab, look for a filter bar (usually at the top).
  6. Click on "XHR" or "Fetch/XHR".
     
Step B :
1. Sort the rows according to the size column in descending order (so the biggest JSON is at the top).
2. Look for a JSON with the following name (it's usually the first one):
   
   rest_scan.py?hash=**YourHashString**&lang=he
4. Double-click to open the file in a new tab, then press Ctrl + S to save it on your PC.
   
Step C :

Run the application, load the Jason file, and get a random restaurant :)
